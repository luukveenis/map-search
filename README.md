# Map Search

This is the first assignment for CSC 421 in the fall of 2015.

## The Problem

Utilize informed and uninformed search algorithms to find routes between two
connected cities on a map. This project will generate random map instances in an
intelligent way and compare the performance of various algorithms to find the
best route between two randomly selected cities.
